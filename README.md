# Movie Trailer WebSite #

This program is based on the program provided with the Udacity Full Stack Developer to start. Several new things have been added in this implementation.


To run the program as is type
` python entertainment_center.py`

in the terminal
This will run the program in its current implementation and the current movies that are stored will be displayed.

## New Additions ##

* A new background with a linear-gradient

* Several new styles have been applied to various text in the HTML document.

* There are several new divs inside the movie-tile div that display the storyline and actors for each movie.

* Jquery scripting to show/hide the storyline and actors for each movie.

* The class object in media.py now has a field for storing the starring actors names.

* Three buttons for every movie tile.

* The foreach loop in fresh_tomatoes.py also now adds more class information into the document, such as a storyline and the starring actors.

### Bugs ###

Currently each Bio or Actors button on the movie tile when clicked will make all storylines or actor lists appear. This is just a simple problem with the jquery, this issue will be fixed in the next implementation.
